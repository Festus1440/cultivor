# cultivor
A social media app created with node JS to learn about server side programming and hosting

This app was made with a custom server and works by responding to the client with different responses depending on the request.
This app leverages Flutter's UX/UI functionality to create a material design that is familiar to the majority of users. The front end UI is also driven by flutterâ€™s dart programming language to send and request data from the server etc.
The custom server is built from scratch and uses node JS as server side programming language. The server is hosted on heroku and I use it to accept HTTP requests from the client and respond with information and or any errors.
The custom server on heroku also interacts with a database hosted with mongoDB. The database stores user account information and generated content.
